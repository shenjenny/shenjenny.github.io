        Previously I was the Co-founder and Product Designer of
        <a href="http://signup.swiip.me" target="_blank">Swiip</a>, an iOS to-do list app that gives users tangible rewards.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="semi-bold">The problem:</span>
        high school and university students often procrastinate because they are overwhelmed by chores, homework and things to do among all the distractions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="semi-bold">The solution:</span>
        By providing users progress reports and rewards for doing their tasks, users would feel their productive efforts are being appreciated and they can manage their time and tasks better.

          <span class="heading">I want to make Dropbox better</span>
          <br/>
          <span class="subheading">here are some of my suggestions</span>

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <span class="semi-bold">Language support in Traditional Chinese.</span>

                <p>
                  During a Google Adwords campaign I created for Dropbox, I discovered how Dropbox can reach international target markets more effectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In short, Taiwan has the highest web search interest in Dropbox worldwide. However, potential users from Taiwan would look up tutorials rather than sign up directly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ads were shown 4,987 times in 6 days and helped me earned maximum bonus space.

            </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="semi-bold">Wording choice on the Android app.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                To remove an item from the favorite list, ‘Unfavorite’ would make more sense than ‘Favorite’.
              </p>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <img src="favorite.png">

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="semi-bold">A feature to favorite a folder.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                Users store items in categories (as folders), so it’s likely that if they favorite something in a folder, there will be other items in the same folder that they want to store offline as well. Having this option saves the time to favorite multiple or even every item in a folder that they want to save.
              </p>
            </li>

          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="semi-bold">A feature to favorite items from the web app.</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                Users store something offline because they’d like to retrieve it quickly, most likely without Internet access.
              </p>
              <p>
                It would be more convenient if users can star the items they want for offline access while they are on the computer. When they are on the go and need the files, they can simply open the mobile app, and the files would be there synced for them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The experience would be smoother and more consistent if users can see their favorite items on the web app.
